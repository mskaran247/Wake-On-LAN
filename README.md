# Wake-On-LAN
Wake-on-LAN Application by Mansingh Karan

This Wake-on-LAN (WoL) application is designed to remotely power on computers and systems that support the Wake-on-LAN feature. Many motherboards from leading manufacturers such as Intel, Gigabyte, and others offer compatibility with this functionality.

With this application, users can start their systems remotely—no physical presence required. It supports both individual devices and device groups, allowing users to power on multiple systems with a single click. A few seconds after sending the Wake-on-LAN signal, users can verify whether a system is online using the built-in ping check feature.

All activities are automatically logged for transparency and tracking. Logs can be filtered based on various criteria and exported in CSV or JSON format for reporting or auditing purposes.

This application is completely free—forever.

Screenshots of the application interface are attached for reference.
